     * A HandleGraph implementation that represents a subgraph of another
     * HandleGraph, defined by an internal tree whose nodes and edges are
     * embedded in the nodes and edges of the backing graph.
     *
     * Useful for describing the haplotype tree embedded in a graph, radiating
     * from a certain point.
     *
     * The tree is always exposed as rooted at the left, with child nodes
     * radiating out on the right. The user has to re-orient the handles fed in
     * to match that topology.
     *
     * The root handle can be trimmed on its left side.
     *
     * Supports translation of other Paths from this graph into the base graph.
